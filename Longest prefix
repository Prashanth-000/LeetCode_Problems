//Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
//If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

//Example 1:
//Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
//Output: "fl"

//Example 2:
//Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
//Output: ""
//Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

//Constraints:
//1 <= strs.length <= 200
//0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
//strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
